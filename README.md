This repository containts the task submitted by me for my Intenship at LetsGrowMore for December2021.

**Notebook1 :** 

**Problem Statement** - To create the Decision Tree classifier using IRIS data and visualize it graphically.

Iris data has 3 unique species - ['setosa', 'versicolor', 'virginica'] with 50 records each. We created a model using Decision tree alorithm with 95.5% accuracy and plotted it using plot_tree() of sklearn. Model was able to classify all the features of Setosa but there were few miss-classification in Versicolr and Virginica.
